started taking lariam this weekend for africa. it comes with the following warning label. "Take weekly one week prior to entering heavily melarious areas. May cause vivid dreams in some patients." 

Here are some of the highlights- 

<ul>
<li>It turns out I can do a standing double front flip. the trick is to do a regular standing front-flip and just keep doing more of that again. This is great news, because I've always wanted to do a standing double front flip, and actually, I think this same trick may apply to a standing triple front flip, although I can't confirm that from the dream. Unfortunately, I can't actually do a standing front flip, so this doesn't help me that much. I've confirmed that it doesn't work for somersaults. 
</li>
<li>Do not get dream Mike Sego angry. Real-life Mike Sego is incredibly nice and helpful, dream Mike Sego is total jerk. So, me and julie were working on this chemistry experiment, and early on she warned me not to mix the green and the orange, but I must have forgotten or something, and she exploded. Anyway, Mike Sego finds out, and he's really angry. And he starts getting all intense, "Sasha, I'm not angry. I'm just so very, very disappointed ... in you." God, what can you say to that? I just don't think there is anything you can say to that. 
</li>
<li> In the office, 5th floor. putnam walks in with this huge object. "hey guys, I got this on the internet" turns it on. suddenly everything goes ghostbusters. stuff starts flying around, windows are breaking, crt monitors are getting thrown about, 80s special effects galore. looks like we're all dead, but then my really old israeli cs professor walks in and gets super haxor on the box while dodging the flying monitors. he fixes everything and teleports away. It ends with cpiro making some ridiculous action movie one-liner, god I wish I remember what it was. I'm gonna go with "putnam, looks like you should have been monitoring that situation!" lols all around.
