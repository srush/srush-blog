<big> Smart people have the coolest hobbies</big>

- Hi I'm Sasha, nice to meet you. 
- Hey. 
- So I see on your resume that you are a Champion Kickboxer. 
- Well. I won an amateur contest once. 
- Were you in the olympics?
- No, not really. 
- So what is the hardest part about kick boxing.

- So what do you consider your biggest strength. 
- I really like massively distributed-

<big>Kids these days have no soul.</big>

- And that is how you code depth-first search. 
- umm...
- Is something wrong?

- Well, you did it right, but there was no passion.
- ok.
- Do it again from the top, this time with feeling. 

<big>There's nowhere to hide.</big>

- Do you have a business card?
- Nope. 
- Well can I just get your phone number.
- umm, I think my phone is broken right now. 
- Email?
- Also broken. 
- Ok, I guess I'll just look you up on Facebook. 
- What's Facebook?
